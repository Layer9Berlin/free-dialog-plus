This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run extract`

Extract strings into translation .po files located in the `locales` folder.\
Translations can be added or updated in these files.

### `npm run compile`
